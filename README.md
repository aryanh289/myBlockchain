# myBlockchain
A prototype project that explains and demonstrates a blockchain named "falcon". <br> 
This blockchain has been developed using javascript, Node.js and ExpressJs. Falcon is running on 5 nodes of express and is expandable.  <br>
<br>

I will really be happy to collaborate on this project.
<br><br>
1. This project has been created under the guidance of `Eric Traub` who is a software engineer at Newyork city.<br>
2. The book i used for learning and developing this: "Learn Blockchain programming with JavaScript" by `Packt`.<br>
<br>
# For running this project: <br>
1. Run "npm install". <br>
2. Open 5 terminals and on each, run seperate node: `npm run node_1`, 2,3,4,5 respectively.<br>
3. After running all 5 nodes, our decentralised distributed ledger "falcon" will be up and running.<br>
4. Open a browser, and type `http://localhost:3001/blockchain` and you will get the complete view of a blockchain.<br>
5. To add anything to the blockchain, there is nothing interactive, and this whole project is api based, so to make this functional, you have to install<br> `Postman`, an API calling application and you have to make requests to your blockchain. Then only you can add blocks to the chain.<br>

`If you are interested in creating a frontend and contributing on this project in any way. I would love to hear from you!`
